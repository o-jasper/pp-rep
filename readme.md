# Per-participant Reputation system approach for Ethereum

This project is to help figure out per-participant reputation systems. I.e. each
participant has its own opinion about what the reputation of other nodes should
be.

Each participant indicates its opinion about the other participants.

A contract has to be able to prove to other contracts that it has such and such
reputation.
